# Welcome to ENGR 315 

Spring 2020

## Description 

This course provides an introduction hardware/software co-design. It focuses on 
designing systems partially implemented in software and partially in hardware,
with the hardware components designed to accelerate overall application computations.  
We study how hardware and software interact, how the computer system's
architecture impacts this interaction, and how to utilize hardware designs to
partition and accelerate software-based systems.
