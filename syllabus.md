# ENGR 315  Syllabus

Fall, 2022

## Description

This course provides an introduction to hardware acceleration of software-based
applications.  The student will learn how to identify a software application's
performance limitations, how to identify parallel components of the application,
how hardware and software interact, how the computer system's architecture
impacts this interaction, and methods for improving application performance by
mapping portions of the application's computation into hardware accelerators. 

Having completed this course, you will have experience with the following: 

 * Identifying performance bottlenecks in simple software applications and
    optimizing them algorithmicially to improve performance
 
 * Transforming portions of software applications into hardware 
    descriptions of equivalent behavior

 * Utilizing high-speed hardware-software interfaces to move data between
    hardware and software

 * Adding customized hardware accelerators to improve the overall performance of a
    software application.

## Textbooks

Lectures will loosely follow material taken from two different books, listed
below.  **Both books are available for free to IU students**.

[Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-3737-6)

IU students can access the PDF for free at [SpringerLink](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-3737-6)  
( Requires on-campus access.  Please do not post or redistribute the PDFs. )

Additional materials may be provided on an as-needed basis on the course website.

## Topics Covered

* Performance Profiling
* Performance Optimizations 
* Hardware Accelerator Designs
  * On-Chip Buses
  * Memory-Mapped Input/Output (MMIO)
  * Direct Memory Access (DMA)
* Hardware Performance Optimizations
* Accelerating Applications through software/hardware co-design 

## Projects

Over the course of the semester, we will assign multiple programming projects.
Full points will requires these projects be submitted to the autograder and/or be
demonstrated to the course staff. 

## Due Dates and Extensions

**Assignments turned in after the exact time and date specified on the
assignment will receive a zero**. We do not generally offer extensions. For
example, we do not offer extensions due to crowded computing sites, long queue
times or slow response times on the autograder, internet access problems,
accidental erasure or loss of files, or outside conflicting commitments.

We will consider extension requests made in person and at least two weeks in
advance, for example, for religious holidays or planned medical procedures.
Additionally, we will consider requests for extensions due to documented,
unanticipated medical or personal emergencies. If you can't see the instructor
in advance due to the emergency, then contact them as soon as you possibly can.
In all cases, we require written proof of the emergency.

## Grading

Your final grade is based on scores from exams, the programming projects, and
the final design challenge. The tentative point distribution is included in the
following table. It is not likely that this will change, but circumstances might
occur which would make changes necessary, at the discretion of the instructor.
*Once a grade has been posted to Canvas, you will have one week to appeal the
grade.*

| Exam     | Projects  |  Design Challenge   | Design Report|
| -------- |  ---      | -------------       | --           |
|    25%   |  45%      |    15%              | 15%          |


## The Autograder

We will grade your programs in an autograder system that is similar to the Linux
environment. Your code must be submitted, compile, and run correctly on the
autograder before the deadline. We use a web-based autograder for project
submissions. For some projects, the autograder will also evaluate the
thoroughness of test cases you submit.

## Academic Integrity

Learning difficult or complicated material is often facilitated by discussions
between students and we encourage you to form study groups to try to solve
difficult problems together.

However, **exams and programming projects must be your own work**. Do not cheat
in any way: do your own work! Doing your own work means that you must turn in
your own, original work. It means you do not turn in a solution copied from
somebody else or found on the web. In programming projects, working together may
extend to figuring out overall strategies for solution but **you may not work
together or share the actual code** that you submit.

For group projects, code sharing within the group is encouraged. Sharing code
outside the group is not allowed.  

## Disability Services for Students

If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your
instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of
this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As
soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of
Disability Services for Students (DSS) help us determine appropriate academic
accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will
be treated as such.

## Corrections and Clarifications

We will post a Canvas announcement in the case of any critical corrections or
clarifications. It is your responsibility to ensure you are able to receive
Canvas announcements.
